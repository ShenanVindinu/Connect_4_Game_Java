### FAQ

**Q: Can I delete the `.gitkeep` file in `lk.ijse.dep.service` package?**<br>
Yes, you can

**Q: Why can't I run any games that are in the release page?**<br>
Open a terminal window and type `java -version` to find out the java version. **[You should have JDK 11 installed](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=406&field_operating_system_target_id=All&field_architecture_target_id=All&field_java_package_target_id=All)** on your system to run these games. **_Other JDK versions might not work._** If you have JDK 11 installed on your system and still unable to run the games, then seek your course instructor's help to get it work.
